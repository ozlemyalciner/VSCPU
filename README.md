# VSCPU
🎤In this project, I have developed a Verilog code for a VSCPU(Very Simple CPU) assembly code that implements floor division. Instruction sheet has been added.
🎤In the testbench section, I have incorporated the memories that store the VSCPU assembly 
   code, which adheres to the concept of floor division. To obtain the memories corresponding 
   to our assembly code, I utilized the simulator implemented in "cpu.tc".
